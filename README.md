# Python ATM Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains a Python program that simulates the behaviour of an ATM. The program is designed to run in Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive experience for users to perform basic banking operations.

## Activity Description

The Python ATM Simulation activity is part of a programming exercise where different Python concepts were applied to build an ATM simulation program. The key features of this activity include:

- Displaying a main menu with options to check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit.
- Optional PIN verification to access the ATM menu.
- Handling withdrawal scenarios, including predefined amounts and the option for a custom amount.
- Providing a sub-menu for different withdrawal amounts.
- Displaying the current account balance and updating it based on user actions.
